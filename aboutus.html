                <p>Detroit Donate Up was created in 2011, with one goal in mind: to be able to help our planet get back
                    to its
                    former glory
                    to help the future generations live their best life on a clean planet, and be able to enjoy a
                    freshly healed
                    Earth.
                    So here at Detroit Donate Up, we decided to come together and put our brains together to think of a
                    way that can
                    help the economy -and the community-
                    and benefits the Earth as well.

                </p>

                Here at Detroit Donate Up, we strive to help everyone on this planet that we have the opportunity and
                privilege to live on. Scientists have determined that we only have 50-250 years on this Earth before
                everything goes to......droppings.

                As human beings on this Earth, we want to do our part to help the environment, the place that we call
                home, because we only have one Earth, and it seems right that we take care of our home and our
                surroundings. It may seem small at first, but we are doing the best we can to reduce and reverse the
                effects of our ancestors and predecessors.

                Our organization isn't the only way to help the Earth, but it's one of them. So join us in our fight to
                save our Earth for generations to come, and live clean and healthy!</p>
