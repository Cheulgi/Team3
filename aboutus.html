    <h4>About Our Organization</h4>
    <p>Detroit Donate Up was created in 2011, with one goal in mind: to be able to help our planet get back to its
        former glory
        to help the future generations live their best life on a clean planet, and be able to enjoy a freshly healed
        Earth.
        So here at Detroit Donate Up, we decided to come together and put our brains together to think of a way that can
        help the economy -and the community-
        and benefits the Earth as well.

    </p>
